# FinalYearProject

For Friday the initial prototypes need to be done:
- Splash screen with a login/register button
- register and log in page with linked database (firebase) ; https://console.firebase.google.com/project/pizza-mia-mobile-app/overview
- 1 or 2 food items on menu page that can be added to cart and automatic total calculated in cart

Don't have high expectations so if I get a login/register working I'd be happy :s
